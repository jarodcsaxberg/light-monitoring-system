# Light Monitoring System

This project seeks to design a light sensor that can be placed in the Hoosier National Forest for a prolonged period of time. The sensor will collect data on the light conditions during the night to obtain an official designation from the International Dark Sky Association (ISDA) for the Hoosier National Forest. The designation is important to attract more visitors to the Forest, to create community-involved programs regarding data collection from the sensors, and to teach people about what the IDSA association strives to do and why it is important.

## Project Code

The code can be found in [project/](https://github.com/jarodcsaxberg/light-monitoring-system/tree/master/project), with the custom written code found in [project/Inc](https://github.com/jarodcsaxberg/light-monitoring-system/tree/master/project/Inc) and [project/Src](https://github.com/jarodcsaxberg/light-monitoring-system/tree/master/project/Src).
